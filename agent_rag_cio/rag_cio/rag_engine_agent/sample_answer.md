The general themes in asset allocation center on improving portfolio quality and diversification, particularly given elevated uncertainty, trade disruptions, weakening consumer demand, rising interest rates, and stagflationary risks. There is a preference for an "up-in-quality" bias and a focus on assets that offer diversification tools, especially given the increasingly positive correlation between stocks and bonds.

Here's a summary of general themes and the latest tactical asset allocations (TAA) as of June 2025:

### Overall Investment Strategy
The overarching strategy is to enhance portfolio quality and diversification. This involves maintaining a neutral overall equity position while shifting allocations within equities towards higher-quality exposures and increasing diversification tools such as gold. The current environment does not favor adding significant risk.

### Asset Class Breakdown and Allocations

#### 1. Equities
*   **General Themes:**
    *   **Shift from Small and Mid-Cap (SMID):** The allocation to global SMID equities has been eliminated due to a view that this segment is poorly positioned relative to the macro outlook. Concerns include a volatile and uncertain trade environment, rising expenses, uneven demand, shifting supply chains, and the impact of higher short-term rates on smaller firms with greater floating-rate debt.
    *   **Preference for Large Cap:** Exposure has shifted towards large-cap equities, particularly AI-heavy US large caps, which are believed to have more sustainable earnings in an uncertain macroeconomic regime.
    *   **Regional Diversification:** Increased allocation to Europe and China (specifically large caps) due to potential for capital flows and policy support in these regions.
    *   **Sectoral Insights:** Information Technology, especially Big Tech, is resilient and expected to grow earnings faster than the S&P 500 in 2025, 2026, and 2027. Financials and Industrials have significant weightings in various cap sizes, while Materials and Real Estate are more prevalent in Small and Mid Cap indices. Health Care tilts towards growth in mid and small caps and value in large caps.
    *   **Non-US Equities:** For non-US equities, there is a preference for high-quality dividend growers.
*   **Tactical Asset Allocations (TAA):**
    *   **Total Equities:** 60.0%
    *   **Developed Equities (Total):** 50.6%
        *   US Large Cap: 37.7%
        *   Canada Large Cap: 1.4%
        *   UK Large Cap: 1.7%
        *   Europe ex-UK Large Cap: 5.9%
        *   Asia ex-Japan Large Cap: 1.3%
        *   Japan Large Cap: 2.6%
        *   Small and Mid Cap (SMID): 0.0%
    *   **Emerging Market Equity (Total):** 9.4%

        *   Latin America EM Equity: 0.7%
        *   Europe, Middle East & Africa EM Equity: 0.5%

#### 2. Fixed Income
*   **General Themes:**
    *   **Quality Bias:** A preference for high-quality fixed income assets and a duration slightly shorter than the benchmark.
    *   **Overweight US Investment Grade:** Overweight stance in investment grade US bonds, including US Treasuries and US Securitized assets.
    *   **Exit from Preferreds:** Exited thematic exposure to US Preferreds due to valuations being very rich relative to comparable sectors like investment grade credit, and concerns about their diversification capabilities in a slowing economy.
    *   **Less Favorable on Lower-Yielding/Higher Risk:** Less keen on lower-yielding bonds in Japan and Europe, High Yield debt, and Emerging Market debt.
*   **Tactical Asset Allocations (TAA):**
    *   **Total Fixed Income:** 37.1%
    *   Developed Sovereign (Total): 18.8%
        *   US Developed Sovereign: 14.2%
        *   Non-US Developed Sovereign: 4.6%

    *   Developed Investment Grade Corporates: 6.6%
    *   High Yield: 1.7%
    *   Emerging Market Sovereigns: 2.2%
    *   Thematic: Preferreds: 0.0%

#### 3. Commodities
*   **General Themes:**
    *   **Diversification Tool:** A new allocation to gold was added to provide diversification, acting as a potential hedge if economic data deteriorates further or geopolitical risks rise.
*   **Tactical Asset Allocations (TAA):**
    *   **Total Commodities:** 2.0% (specifically Gold)

#### 4. Cash
*   **General Themes:** Underweight.
*   **Tactical Asset Allocations (TAA):**
    *   **Cash:** 1.0%
