We eliminated our 5.8% position in Global \r\nSMID (small- and mid-cap) equities, \r\nreallocating 4% into US large cap equities, 1% \r\ninto European equities, and 0.8% Chinese \r\nlarge caps.\r\n2. We exited our 2% thematic position in \r\nPreferreds.\r\n3. We added a 2% position in gold.\r\nFollowing a furious rebound in risk assets from the \r\npost-tariff announcement lows, we have re￾examined the risk/ reward of our current portfolio \r\nstrategy. Although we view headwinds to growth and \r\nearnings as considerable in 2H25, our assessment is \r\nthat current positioning and pricing does not reflect \r\nthese risks. We prefer to maintain an up-in-quality \r\nbias to the portfolio while adding some \r\ndiversification within equities and initiating a new \r\nposition in gold.\r\nEquities: we cut our 5.8% allocation to global SMID, a \r\nsegment which in our view is poorly positioned \r\nrelative to the macro outlook. A volatile and highly \r\nuncertain trade environment favors firms with scale \r\nand flexibility to manage rising expenses, uneven \r\ndemand, and shifting supply chains. Higher-for￾longer short-term rates will impact small firm margins \r\nmore acutely as they tend to operate with a greater \r\nshare of floating rate debt than large caps. We shift most of our SMID exposure into AI-heavy US large caps (+4%), which we \r\nbelieve will have more sustainable earnings in an uncertain macro regime. We also added diversification to the portfolio by \r\nadding 1% to Europe and 0.8% to China, two regions where the scope for flows and policy support remain high. This trade \r\nmaintains our neutral equity position, while shifting our allocation to higher quality exposures.\r\nRisk diversification: Increasingly frequent bouts of positive stock-bond correlation have led us to consider a wider range of\r\nportfolio diversification tools. We added a 2% allocation to gold, which in our view may act to provide positive returns if either \r\nthe economic data deteriorates further and/or geopolitical risks rise from here. We fund this move by eliminating our thematic \r\nexposure to US Preferreds. Preferred equity returns have proved resilient so far this year, but these securities have historically \r\noffered less diversification to equity risk when the economy slows. Preferred equity valuations are now very rich relative to\r\ncomparable sectors like investment grade credit, providing us a good opportunity to exit."

We eliminated our 5.8% position in Global \r\nSMID (small- and mid-cap) equities, \r\nreallocating 4% into US large cap equities, 1% \r\ninto European equities, and 0.8% Chinese \r\nlarge caps.\r\n2. We exited our 2% thematic position in \r\nPreferreds.\r\n3. We added a 2% position in gold.\r\nFollowing a furious rebound in risk assets from the \r\npost-tariff announcement lows, we have re￾examined the risk/ reward of our current portfolio \r\nstrategy. Although we view headwinds to growth and \r\nearnings as considerable in 2H25, our assessment is \r\nthat current positioning and pricing does not reflect \r\nthese risks. We prefer to maintain an up-in-quality \r\nbias to the portfolio while adding some \r\ndiversification within equities and initiating a new \r\nposition in gold.\r\nEquities: we cut our 5.8% allocation to global SMID, a \r\nsegment which in our view is poorly positioned \r\nrelative to the macro outlook. A volatile and highly \r\nuncertain trade environment favors firms with scale \r\nand flexibility to manage rising expenses, uneven \r\ndemand, and shifting supply chains. Higher-for￾longer short-term rates will impact small firm margins \r\nmore acutely as they tend to operate with a greater \r\nshare of floating rate debt than large caps. We shift most of our SMID exposure into AI-heavy US large caps (+4%), which we \r\nbelieve will have more sustainable earnings in an uncertain macro regime. We also added diversification to the portfolio by \r\nadding 1% to Europe and 0.8% to China, two regions where the scope for flows and policy support remain high. This trade \r\nmaintains our neutral equity position, while shifting our allocation to higher quality exposures.\r\nRisk diversification: Increasingly frequent bouts of positive stock-bond correlation have led us to consider a wider range of\r\nportfolio diversification tools. We added a 2% allocation to gold, which in our view may act to provide positive returns if either \r\nthe economic data deteriorates further and/or geopolitical risks rise from here. We fund this move by eliminating our thematic \r\nexposure to US Preferreds. Preferred equity returns have proved resilient so far this year, but these securities have historically \r\noffered less diversification to equity risk when the economy slows. Preferred equity valuations are now very rich relative to\r\ncomparable sectors like investment grade credit, providing us a good opportunity to exit."

We shift most of our SMID exposure into AI-heavy US large caps (+4%), which we \r\nbelieve will have more sustainable earnings in an uncertain macro regime. We also added diversification to the portfolio by \r\nadding 1% to Europe and 0.8% to China, two regions where the scope for flows and policy support remain high. This trade \r\nmaintains our neutral equity position, while shifting our allocation to higher quality exposures.\r\nRisk diversification: Increasingly frequent bouts of positive stock-bond correlation have led us to consider a wider range of\r\nportfolio diversification tools. We added a 2% allocation to gold, which in our view may act to provide positive returns if either \r\nthe economic data deteriorates further and/or geopolitical risks rise from here. We fund this move by eliminating our thematic \r\nexposure to US Preferreds. Preferred equity returns have proved resilient so far this year, but these securities have historically \r\noffered less diversification to equity risk when the economy slows. Preferred equity valuations are now very rich relative to\r\ncomparable sectors like investment grade credit, providing us a good opportunity to exit.",

We also added diversification to the portfolio by \r\nadding 1% to Europe and 0.8% to China, two regions where the scope for flows and policy support remain high. This trade \r\nmaintains our neutral equity position, while shifting our allocation to higher quality exposures.\r\nRisk diversification: Increasingly frequent bouts of positive stock-bond correlation have led us to consider a wider range of\r\nportfolio diversification tools. We added a 2% allocation to gold, which in our view may act to provide positive returns if either \r\nthe economic data deteriorates further and/or geopolitical risks rise from here. We fund this move by eliminating our thematic \r\nexposure to US Preferreds. Preferred equity returns have proved resilient so far this year, but these securities have historically \r\noffered less diversification to equity risk when the economy slows.

Maintained a preference for large-cap firms due to macro outlook and interest rate environment.\n*   **Diversification:** Added a 2% position in Gold for risk diversification.\n*   **Other:** Exited thematic position in Preferreds. Overweight Global Fixed Income and underweight Cash (April 7, 2025).\n\n---\n\n**Robert Williams (CUST300) - As of August 6, 2025:**\n*   **Equities:** Aligns with the CIO theme of eliminating SMID (0% US_SMID). His 50% US Large Cap allocation aligns with the preference for large caps, though the breakdown (20% Tech, 30% ex-Tech) shows only part of his large-cap exposure is in AI-heavy tech as preferred by the CIO.\n*   **Diversification:** His 10% allocation to Gold significantly exceeds the CIO's new 2% allocation, indicating a stronger conviction in gold for diversification.\n*   **Fixed Income/Cash:** His 0% Cash aligns with the CIO's underweight cash theme. His 20% allocation to Munis (Fixed Income) is lower than the CIO's overweight to Global Fixed Income (37.1% TAA).\n\n**Sarah Feng (CUST500) - As of August 6, 2025:**\n*   **Equities:** Her 20% allocation to US_SMID is contrary to the CIO's theme of eliminating SMID. Her 40% US Large Cap allocation aligns with the preference for large caps.\n*   **Diversification:** Her 0% allocation to Gold is contrary to the CIO's theme of adding gold for diversification.\n*   **Fixed Income/Cash:** Her 5% Cash allocation is higher than the CIO's underweight cash theme. Her 35% Investment Grade Bonds (Fixed Income) is close to the CIO's 37.1% TAA for Fixed Income.\n\n**Emily Smith (CUST100) - As of August 6, 2025:**\n*   **Equities:** Her 0% allocation to equities aligns with the CIO's elimination of SMID, but also indicates no exposure to the preferred large-cap segments.\n*   **Diversification:** Her 0% allocation to Gold is contrary to the CIO's theme of adding gold for diversification.\n*   **Fixed Income/Cash:** Her 30% Cash allocation is significantly higher than the CIO's underweight cash theme. Her 70% Investment Grade Bonds (Fixed Income) indicates a substantial overweight in fixed income compared to the CIO's 37.1% TAA.\n\n**Jessica Brown (CUST400) - As of August 6, 2025:**\n*   **Equities:** Her 10% allocation to US_SMID is contrary to the CIO's theme of eliminating SMID. She has no US Large Cap allocation.\n*   **Diversification:** Her 0% allocation to Gold is contrary to the CIO's theme of adding gold for diversification.\n*   **Fixed Income/Cash:** Her 30% Cash allocation is significantly higher than the CIO's underweight cash theme. Her 60% Investment Grade Bonds (Fixed Income) indicates a significant overweight in fixed income compared to the CIO's 37.1% TAA.\n\n**Michael Johnson (CUST200) - As of January 1, 2025:**\n*   **Equities:** His 0% allocation to US_SMID aligns with the CIO's theme of eliminating SMID. His 40% US Large Cap allocation, specifically 40% in US_LC_Tech, strongly aligns with the CIO's preference for AI-heavy US large caps.\n*   **Diversification:** His 0% allocation to Gold is contrary to the CIO's theme of adding gold for diversification.\n*   **Fixed Income/Cash:** His 0% Cash aligns with the CIO's underweight cash theme. His 60% Investment Grade Bonds (Fixed Income) indicates a significant overweight in fixed income compared to the CIO's 37.1% TAA."

We eliminated our 5.8% position in Global \r\nSMID (small- and mid-cap) equities, \r\nreallocating 4% into US large cap equities, 1% \r\ninto European equities, and 0.8% Chinese \r\nlarge caps.\r\n2. We exited our 2% thematic position in \r\nPreferreds.\r\n3. We added a 2% position in gold.\r\nFollowing a furious rebound in risk assets from the \r\npost-tariff announcement lows, we have re￾examined the risk/ reward of our current portfolio \r\nstrategy. Although we view headwinds to growth and \r\nearnings as considerable in 2H25, our assessment is \r\nthat current positioning and pricing does not reflect \r\nthese risks. We prefer to maintain an up-in-quality \r\nbias to the portfolio while adding some \r\ndiversification within equities and initiating a new \r\nposition in gold.\r\nEquities: we cut our 5.8% allocation to global SMID, a \r\nsegment which in our view is poorly positioned \r\nrelative to the macro outlook. A volatile and highly \r\nuncertain trade environment favors firms with scale \r\nand flexibility to manage rising expenses, uneven \r\ndemand, and shifting supply chains. Higher-for￾longer short-term rates will impact small firm margins \r\nmore acutely as they tend to operate with a greater \r\nshare of floating rate debt than large caps. We shift most of our SMID exposure into AI-heavy US large caps (+4%), which we \r\nbelieve will have more sustainable earnings in an uncertain macro regime. We also added diversification to the portfolio by \r\nadding 1% to Europe and 0.8% to China, two regions where the scope for flows and policy support remain high. This trade \r\nmaintains our neutral equity position, while shifting our allocation to higher quality exposures.\r\nRisk diversification: Increasingly frequent bouts of positive stock-bond correlation have led us to consider a wider range of\r\nportfolio diversification tools. We added a 2% allocation to gold, which in our view may act to provide positive returns if either \r\nthe economic data deteriorates further and/or geopolitical risks rise from here. We fund this move by eliminating our thematic \r\nexposure to US Preferreds. Preferred equity returns have proved resilient so far this year, but these securities have historically \r\noffered less diversification to equity risk when the economy slows. Preferred equity valuations are now very rich relative to\r\ncomparable sectors like investment grade credit, providing us a good opportunity to exit."

We prefer to maintain an up-in-quality \r\nbias to the portfolio while adding some \r\ndiversification within equities and initiating a new \r\nposition in gold.\r\nEquities: we cut our 5.8% allocation to global SMID, a \r\nsegment which in our view is poorly positioned \r\nrelative to the macro outlook. A volatile and highly \r\nuncertain trade environment favors firms with scale \r\nand flexibility to manage rising expenses, uneven \r\ndemand, and shifting supply chains. Higher-for�longer short-term rates will impact small firm margins \r\nmore acutely as they tend to operate with a greater \r\nshare of floating rate debt than large caps. We shift most of our SMID exposure into AI-heavy US large caps (+4%), which we \r\nbelieve will have more sustainable earnings in an uncertain macro regime. We also added diversification to the portfolio by \r\nadding 1% to Europe and 0.8% to China, two regions where the scope for flows and policy support remain high. This trade \r\nmaintains our neutral equity position, while shifting our allocation to higher quality exposures.\r\nRisk diversification: Increasingly frequent bouts of positive stock-bond correlation have led us to consider a wider range of\r\nportfolio diversification tools. We added a 2% allocation to gold, which in our view may act to provide positive returns if either \r\nthe economic data deteriorates further and/or geopolitical risks rise from here. We fund this move by eliminating our thematic \r\nexposure to US Preferreds. Preferred equity returns have proved resilient so far this year, but these securities have historically \r\noffered less diversification to equity risk when the economy slows. Preferred equity valuations are now very rich relative to\r\ncomparable sectors like investment grade credit, providing us a good opportunity to exit.",

Large caps tend to outperform when sentiment is high. Smaller companies carry higher risks including business, price fluctuation, and illiquidity.\n*   **Sector Focus:**\n    *   **Information Technology (IT) & Healthcare:** Show rising earnings and market cap share, representing future economic trends. IT sector generates over 50% of its revenue abroad.\n    *   **Dividend Growers:** Comprise a mix of defensive and cyclical sectors (e.g., Industrials, Consumer Staples, Financials, Materials, Utilities, Real Estate, Energy, Healthcare, IT, Consumer Discretionary). Energy, Real Estate, Materials, and Industrials tend to perform well during periods of accelerating inflation.\n*   **Growth vs. Value:** Growth stocks and Developed Markets (like the US) have historically moved in sync, as have Value stocks and Emerging Markets. US stocks are generally aligned with growth.\n*   **World Equity Flows:** World Equity Funds have been experiencing outflows.\n\n---\n\n**Client Portfolio Comparison:**\n\n**Robert Williams (CUST300) - As of August 6, 2025:**\n*   **Small vs. Large Cap:** Allocates 0% to US Small/Mid Cap (US_SMID), indicating a preference for large caps.\n*   **Sector Focus:** His 50% US Large Cap includes 20% in Technology (US_LC_Tech), aligning with the rising importance of IT.\n*   **Growth vs. Value:** His significant US Large Cap allocation supports alignment with growth-oriented US stocks.\n\n**Sarah Feng (CUST500) - As of August 6, 2025:**\n*   **Small vs. Large Cap:** Holds 20% in US Small/Mid Cap (US_SMID), which introduces higher risks associated with smaller companies.\n*   **Sector Focus:** Her 40% US Large Cap includes 10% in Technology (US_LC_Tech), reflecting some exposure to the rising IT sector.\n*   **Growth vs. Value:** Her US Large Cap allocation is consistent with growth-aligned US stocks.\n\n**Emily Smith (CUST100) - As of August 6, 2025:**\n*   **Small vs. Large Cap:** Holds 0% in both US Large Cap (US_LC) and US Small/Mid Cap (US_SMID), indicating no direct equity exposure to these themes.\n*   **Sector Focus:** No direct equity exposure means no alignment with specific sector trends.\n*   **Growth vs. Value:** No direct equity exposure means no alignment with growth or value themes.\n\n**Jessica Brown (CUST400) - As of August 6, 2025:**\n*   **Small vs. Large Cap:** Allocates 10% to US Small/Mid Cap (US_SMID), introducing exposure to the higher risks of smaller companies.\n*   **Sector Focus:** Holds 0% in US Large Cap (US_LC), so no direct alignment with IT/Healthcare growth trends from this segment.\n*   **Growth vs. Value:** No direct US Large Cap exposure for alignment with growth-oriented US stocks.\n\n**Michael Johnson (CUST200) - As of January 1, 2025:**\n*   **Small vs. Large Cap:** Allocates 0% to US Small/Mid Cap (US_SMID), indicating a focus on larger companies.\n*   **Sector Focus:** His 40% US Large Cap is entirely allocated to Technology (US_LC_Tech), strongly aligning with the rising importance and growth trends of the IT sector.\n*   **Growth vs. Value:** His significant US Large Cap Technology allocation aligns with the theme of US stocks being aligned with growth."

These include changes in the level of industrial \r\nactivity using industrial metals (including the availability of substitutes such as manmade or synthetic substitutes); disruptions in the supply chain, from \r\nmining to storage to smelting or refining; adjustments to inventory; variations in production costs, including storage, labor and energy costs; costs \r\nassociated with regulatory compliance, including environmental regulations; and changes in industrial, government and consumer demand, both in \r\nindividual consuming nations and internationally. Index components concentrated in futures contracts on agricultural products, including grains, may \r\nbe subject to a number of additional factors specific to agricultural products that might cause price volatility. These include weather conditions, \r\nincluding floods, drought and freezing conditions; changes in government policies; planting decisions; and changes in demand for agricultural products, \r\nboth with end users and as inputs into various industries.\r\nThe information contained herein is not intended to be an exhaustive discussion of the risks, strategies or concepts mentioned herein or tax or legal \r\nadvice. Readers interested in the strategies or concepts should consult their tax, legal, or other advisors, as appropriate. \r\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and sustainable investing may limit the type and number of investment opportunities, and, as a result may \r\naffect performance relative to other approaches that do not impose similar sustainability criteria. Sustainable investment products are subject to \r\navailability. Certain sustainable investment opportunities may not be available in all regions or not available at all. No guarantee is provided regarding \r\nthe financial or sustainability performance of such products and the products may not meet their investment or sustainability objectives.\r\nThere is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) nor market consensus as to what constitutes, an “ESG”, \r\n“sustainable”, “impact” or an equivalently labelled product, or regarding what precise attributes are required for a particular investment, product or asset \r\nto be defined as such. Different persons may arrive at varied conclusions when evaluating the sustainability attributes of a product or any of its underlying \r\ninvestments. Certain jurisdictional laws and regulations require classifications of investment products against their own sustainability definitions and \r\nas such there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the meaning of such terms. For example, the term “sustainable investing” where used in this disclosure is by reference to CWI’s internal framework rather than any defined meaning under jurisdictional laws and regulations. There is no guarantee \r\nthat investing in these products will have a sustainability impact.\r\nThere are numerous ESG data providers that evaluate companies on their ESG performance and provide reports, ratings, and benchmarks. Report, rating \r\nand benchmark methodology, scope, and coverage, vary greatly among providers. ESG data may not be available for all companies, securities, or \r\ngeographies and as such, may not necessarily be reliable or complete.

              "text": "Investing in smaller companies involves greater risks not associated with investing in more established companies, such as business risk, significant \r\nstock price fluctuations and illiquidity. \r\nFactors affecting commodities generally, index components composed of futures contracts on nickel or copper, which are industrial metals, may be \r\nsubject to a number of additional factors specific to industrial metals that might cause price volatility. These include changes in the level of industrial \r\nactivity using industrial metals (including the availability of substitutes such as manmade or synthetic substitutes); disruptions in the supply chain, from \r\nmining to storage to smelting or refining; adjustments to inventory; variations in production costs, including storage, labor and energy costs; costs \r\nassociated with regulatory compliance, including environmental regulations; and changes in industrial, government and consumer demand, both in \r\nindividual consuming nations and internationally. Index components concentrated in futures contracts on agricultural products, including grains, may \r\nbe subject to a number of additional factors specific to agricultural products that might cause price volatility. These include weather conditions, \r\nincluding floods, drought and freezing conditions; changes in government policies; planting decisions; and changes in demand for agricultural products, \r\nboth with end users and as inputs into various industries.\r\nThe information contained herein is not intended to be an exhaustive discussion of the risks, strategies or concepts mentioned herein or tax or legal \r\nadvice. Readers interested in the strategies or concepts should consult their tax, legal, or other advisors, as appropriate. \r\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and sustainable investing may limit the type and number of investment opportunities, and, as a result may \r\naffect performance relative to other approaches that do not impose similar sustainability criteria. Sustainable investment products are subject to \r\navailability. Certain sustainable investment opportunities may not be available in all regions or not available at all. No guarantee is provided regarding \r\nthe financial or sustainability performance of such products and the products may not meet their investment or sustainability objectives.\r\nThere is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) nor market consensus as to what constitutes, an “ESG”, \r\n“sustainable”, “impact” or an equivalently labelled product, or regarding what precise attributes are required for a particular investment, product or asset \r\nto be defined as such. Different persons may arrive at varied conclusions when evaluating the sustainability attributes of a product or any of its underlying \r\ninvestments. Certain jurisdictional laws and regulations require classifications of investment products against their own sustainability definitions and \r\nas such there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the meaning of such terms. For example, the term “sustainable investing” where used in this disclosure is by reference to CWI’s internal framework rather than any defined meaning under jurisdictional laws and regulations. There is no guarantee \r\nthat investing in these products will have a sustainability impact.\r\nThere are numerous ESG data providers that evaluate companies on their ESG performance and provide reports, ratings, and benchmarks. Report, rating \r\nand benchmark methodology, scope, and coverage, vary greatly among providers. ESG data may not be available for all companies, securities, or \r\ngeographies and as such, may not necessarily be reliable or complete. Such data will also be subject to various limitations, including (inter alia): i) \r\nlimitations in the third-party data provider’s methodologies; ii) data lags, data coverage gaps or other issues impacting the quality of the data; iii) the \r\nfact that there are divergent views, approaches, methodologies and disclosure standards in the market, including among data providers, with respect to \r\nthe identification, assessment, disclosure or determination of “ESG” factors or indicators and which precise attributes are required for a particular \r\ninvestment, product or asset to be defined as such; iv) the fact that ESG information, including where obtained from third-party data providers, may be \r\nbased on qualitative or subjective assessment, and any one data source may not in itself represent a complete ‘picture’ for the ESG metric that it \r\nrepresents; v) the fact that such data may be subject to change without any notice of this to CWI by the third-party data provider or other source. \r\nFurthermore, some of the data CWI obtains from third-party providers is not obtained directly from investee companies, but rather represents estimated \r\n/ proxy data that the third-party data provider has prepared using its own proprietary methodologies (e.g. because there is no actual investee company \r\ndata).

Un dato preocupante es que casi la mitad de los CEO que participaron en la \r\núltima encuesta de Business Roundtable anticipan una disminución del empleo, menores \r\ngastos de capital y una disminución de las ventas de aquí a fin de año. Esto respalda \r\nnuestra opinión de que los equipos de gestión por ahora se resisten a los planes de gasto y \r\ncontratación a gran escala, y solo mantienen sus planes de inversión de capital críticos para \r\nel negocio en áreas como la IA. Seguimos siendo más optimistas sobre la capacidad de las \r\ngrandes empresas estadounidenses para navegar por este entorno en comparación con \r\nlas empresas de pequeña capitalización, y preferimos inclinar nuestra exposición hacia \r\nempresas orientadas al crecimiento que están aprendiendo a escalar y evolucionar con \r\nmenos dependencia del capital humano y con mayor foco en la IA frente a la oferta laboral \r\nafectada por cambios en la inmigración.\r\n• Los datos de empleo respaldan la política actual de la Fed en un contexto de recortes de \r\nprecios del mercado: Los rendimientos en toda la curva recientemente decayeron debido a \r\nla percepción de que la Fed podría bajar las tasas antes de lo que se esperaba, ante el \r\ndebilitamiento de los datos duros y la presión política de la Casa Blanca. Sin embargo, el \r\nsólido informe de empleo de hoy alivia la preocupación a corto plazo por un entorno \r\nestanflacionario, ante signos limitados de un impacto arancelario en la actividad real en \r\neste momento, lo que respalda la postura de espera de la Fed. Si la expectativa de Powell \r\nsobre la inflación asociada a los aranceles no se cumple a finales del verano, prevemos una\r\napertura para un recorte de tasas más cerca de finales de año, con recortes adicionales \r\nprobables en 2026. Los rendimientos a más largo plazo siguen en gran medida las \r\nexpectativas de estos recortes de tasas, así como perspectivas más benignas para la \r\ninflación. Como resultado, los inversionistas están descontando parte de la prima por plazo \r\n(rendimiento adicional requerido para los bonos a más largo plazo) en los rendimientos por \r\nahora, a pesar de un mayor déficit esperado por la probable aprobación del proyecto de ley \r\nde presupuesto de EE. UU. La legislación fiscal, la resiliencia del mercado laboral y la \r\nposibilidad de inflación arancelaria respaldan por ahora nuestro sesgo de \r\ninfraponderación en duración, pero un mayor deterioro de los datos duros y una retórica \r\nmás “dovish” de la Fed serán un catalizador para que nos acerquemos a la exposición de\r\nreferencia.\r\n• La resiliencia de los resultados de las empresas genera el potencial de alzas en el segundo \r\ntrimestre: A pesar del sentimiento cauteloso que reina entre los líderes del sector \r\nempresario, consideramos que la próxima temporada de anuncio de resultados refleja una \r\neconomía aún sólida en el segundo trimestre. Las utilidades por acción de consenso para el \r\nS&P 500 del 2.2% interanual pueden ser una vara baja a superar, con sólo cuatro sectores \r\n(servicios de comunicación, sanidad, tecnología y servicios públicos) que están \r\nposicionados para un crecimiento interanual positivo. Mientras tanto, los preanuncios \r\nnegativos se desaceleran y las revisiones de ganancias están en alza. Entre las ~120 \r\nempresas que han preanunciado sus previsiones para el segundo trimestre, los preanuncios \r\nnegativos se materializan a un ritmo significativamente más lento que el que vimos en el \r\nprimer trimestre de 2025 y el segundo trimestre de 2024, lo que sugiere que los equipos de \r\ngestión se sienten cómodos con las estimaciones de consenso."

Esto respalda \r\nnuestra opinión de que los equipos de gestión por ahora se resisten a los planes de gasto y \r\ncontratación a gran escala, y solo mantienen sus planes de inversión de capital críticos para \r\nel negocio en áreas como la IA. Seguimos siendo más optimistas sobre la capacidad de las \r\ngrandes empresas estadounidenses para navegar por este entorno en comparación con \r\nlas empresas de pequeña capitalización, y preferimos inclinar nuestra exposición hacia \r\nempresas orientadas al crecimiento que están aprendiendo a escalar y evolucionar con \r\nmenos dependencia del capital humano y con mayor foco en la IA frente a la oferta laboral \r\nafectada por cambios en la inmigración.\r\n• Los datos de empleo respaldan la política actual de la Fed en un contexto de recortes de \r\nprecios del mercado: Los rendimientos en toda la curva recientemente decayeron debido a \r\nla percepción de que la Fed podría bajar las tasas antes de lo que se esperaba, ante el \r\ndebilitamiento de los datos duros y la presión política de la Casa Blanca. Sin embargo, el \r\nsólido informe de empleo de hoy alivia la preocupación a corto plazo por un entorno \r\nestanflacionario, ante signos limitados de un impacto arancelario en la actividad real en \r\neste momento, lo que respalda la postura de espera de la Fed. Si la expectativa de Powell \r\nsobre la inflación asociada a los aranceles no se cumple a finales del verano, prevemos una\r\napertura para un recorte de tasas más cerca de finales de año, con recortes adicionales \r\nprobables en 2026. Los rendimientos a más largo plazo siguen en gran medida las \r\nexpectativas de estos recortes de tasas, así como perspectivas más benignas para la \r\ninflación. Como resultado, los inversionistas están descontando parte de la prima por plazo \r\n(rendimiento adicional requerido para los bonos a más largo plazo) en los rendimientos por \r\nahora, a pesar de un mayor déficit esperado por la probable aprobación del proyecto de ley \r\nde presupuesto de EE. UU. La legislación fiscal, la resiliencia del mercado laboral y la \r\nposibilidad de inflación arancelaria respaldan por ahora nuestro sesgo de \r\ninfraponderación en duración, pero un mayor deterioro de los datos duros y una retórica \r\nmás “dovish” de la Fed serán un catalizador para que nos acerquemos a la exposición de\r\nreferencia.\r\n• La resiliencia de los resultados de las empresas genera el potencial de alzas en el segundo \r\ntrimestre: A pesar del sentimiento cauteloso que reina entre los líderes del sector \r\nempresario, consideramos que la próxima temporada de anuncio de resultados refleja una \r\neconomía aún sólida en el segundo trimestre. Las utilidades por acción de consenso para el \r\nS&P 500 del 2.2% interanual pueden ser una vara baja a superar, con sólo cuatro sectores \r\n(servicios de comunicación, sanidad, tecnología y servicios públicos) que están \r\nposicionados para un crecimiento interanual positivo. Mientras tanto, los preanuncios \r\nnegativos se desaceleran y las revisiones de ganancias están en alza. Entre las ~120 \r\nempresas que han preanunciado sus previsiones para el segundo trimestre, los preanuncios \r\nnegativos se materializan a un ritmo significativamente más lento que el que vimos en el \r\nprimer trimestre de 2025 y el segundo trimestre de 2024, lo que sugiere que los equipos de \r\ngestión se sienten cómodos con las estimaciones de consenso.",

We view the near-term benign labor market and temporarily stable inflation \r\nas favorable for an on-hold Federal Reserve, keeping policy rates elevated and supportive \r\nof our short-duration tilt in fixed income.\r\n• As we discussed in last week’s CIO Bulletin, the current US tax bill now under Senate review\r\nwill likely have implications for the persistence of the US fiscal deficit, and in turn may\r\ncontribute to higher US Treasury yields. Recently, the market has newly focused on an \r\nobscure set of potential new rules in the House version of the bill called “Section 899.” This \r\nsection concerns potential taxation of foreign-owned investments in the US. While it is \r\nlikely the Senate will revise these provisions in the face of heavy lobbying, we view the \r\npotential inclusion of this language as disruptive to global asset allocators’ optimal \r\nexposures to US assets and would contribute to further USD weakness. We recently added\r\nto gold along with European and Chinese equities to diversify portfolios against a \r\npotential reduction in appetite for US assets over time.\r\n• With the S&P 500 index up over 20% from its April low and less than 3% from its all-time \r\nhigh, the market has largely priced out the potential future negative impact of recent tariff \r\nannouncements. The recent US international trade court ruling against the use of IEEPA for \r\ntariffs encourages both market participants and trading partners to view end-state tariffs\r\nas far less severe in scope and scale than the market feared on April 2nd, even as reciprocal\r\nand sectoral tariffs may take many months to finalize. We believe corporate management \r\nteams will delay large capex (ex-AI) and hiring plans until further clarity on trade rules, \r\nleading to slower economic growth and shallower EPS gains in 2H25.

Barring a rekindling of animal \r\nspirits and a decisive resolution to trade tensions, we expect further downward revisions.\r\n• Our guidance to clients: We do not have nearly enough ingredients to issue an “all clear “on \r\nrisk assets, as significant downside risks to growth and policy remain.

            "text": "**IMPORTANT: I am an AI Analyst. The information provided is for informational purposes only and is based on our internal knowledge base. It is not financial advice. Please consult with a qualified professional before making any financial decisions.**\n\nTo provide a granular comparison of each client's portfolio against the Chief Investment Officer's (CIO) current views, we will delineate the CIO's detailed allocation and thematic preferences as of June 4, 2025 (with reference to May and April 2025 views where applicable), and then analyze each client's latest reported holdings against these criteria.\n\n---\n\n### **CIO's Granular Themes (As of June 4, 2025, unless noted):**\n\n**I. Equity Strategy:**\n*   **Overall Stance:** Neutral on aggregate global equities, reflecting a view that future returns may be modest or rangebound due to elevated uncertainty. The CIO is holding off on adding risk in the near-term [2, 4, 7].\n*   **Large vs. Small/Mid Cap (SMID):**\n    *   Eliminated the 5.8% position in Global SMID equities [1, 2, 10].\n    *   Prefers higher-quality large-cap firms due to macro outlook, interest rate environment (higher-for-longer short-term rates impacting small firms), tariffs, and for their scale and flexibility [1, 4].\n*   **Regional/Sectoral Preferences within Equities:**\n    *   **US Large Cap:** Reallocated 4% to US large cap equities, specifically favoring AI-heavy components for more sustainable earnings in an uncertain macro regime [1, 2, 10]. Maintains a bias towards high-quality, secular growth (like AI) [7].\n    *   **Europe (ex-UK ex-Switzerland) Large Cap:** Added 1% to European equities due to scope for flows and policy support [1, 2, 10]. Prefers high-quality dividend growers for non-US equities [3, 4].\n    *   **China Large Cap:** Added 0.8% to Chinese large caps due to scope for flows and policy support [1, 2, 10].\n    *   **Other:** Explicitly exited thematic positions in Preferreds [1, 5, 10].\n\n**II. Fixed Income Strategy:**\n*   **Overall Stance:** Moved from 1.0% overweight to 1.0% underweight Global Fixed Income (June 4) [4, 10], previously 1.0% overweight (May) [3].\n*   **Quality & Duration:** Maintains a quality bias and prefers a duration slightly shorter than the benchmark [3, 4].\n*   **Specific Overweights (US Investment Grade):**\n    *   Maintains a significant overweight in investment grade US bonds (7.7% overweight as of May) [3].\n    *   Active exposures include MBS/structured credit (+2.0% as of May and June 4) [3, 4, 2, 5, 10].\n    *   Active exposures include inflation-protected Treasury securities (TIPS) (+1.0% as of May) [3].\n*   **Specific Underweights/Dislikes:**\n    *   Less keen on lower-yielding bonds in Japan and Europe (6.0% underweight) [2, 3, 4, 8, 10].\n    *   Less keen on Developed Market High Yield Debt (1.5% underweight) [2, 3, 4, 8, 10].\n    *   Less keen on Emerging Market Debt (1.0% underweight) [2, 3, 4, 8, 10].\n\n**III. Cash Strategy:**\n*   **Stance:** Consistently underweight cash (1.0% underweight) [2, 3, 4, 8, 10].\n\n**IV. Diversification & Alternatives:**\n*   **Gold:** Added a 2% position in Gold (June 4) for risk diversification, noting its potential to provide positive returns if economic data deteriorates or geopolitical risks rise [1, 2, 4, 5, 10]. This was funded by exiting Preferreds [1, 5].\n*   **Preferreds:** Exited thematic position in Preferreds due to rich valuations and historically offering less diversification during economic slowdowns [1, 5, 10].\n\n**V. Macro Considerations Guiding Views:**\n*   **Economic Growth & Earnings:** Anticipates slower economic growth and shallower EPS gains in 2H25 due to potential corporate delays in capex (ex-AI) and hiring [7]. Headwinds to growth and earnings are considered considerable in 2H25 [1].\n*   **Labor Market:** Views the near-term labor market as benign (cooling but not collapsing) [7].\n*   **Inflation/Interest Rates:** Expects an \"on-hold\" Federal Reserve, keeping policy rates elevated (higher-for-longer short-term rates) [1, 7]. Anticipates some upward pressure on inflation due to tariffs [10].\n*   **Market Valuation/Risk:** Current market positioning and pricing do not reflect identified risks [1]. Not priced for unexpected disappointments; strong recovery requires greater confidence [4].\n*   **Geopolitics/Trade:** Volatile and uncertain trade environment [1]. Tariffs may affect CPI data [10]. Potential for US tax bill to contribute to higher US Treasury yields and USD weakness, potentially reducing appetite for US assets over time [7].\n\n---\n\n### **Client Portfolio Comparison against Granular CIO Themes:**\n\n#### **1. Robert Williams (CUST300) - As of August 6, 2025**\n*   **Overall Alignment Score (Qualitative):** Mixed, with strong divergence on Gold and some equity preferences.\n*   **Equities:**\n    *   **Alignment:** 0% US_SMID aligns with CIO's elimination of SMID [1]. 50% US Large Cap aligns with CIO preference for large caps [1, 4].\n    *   **Deviation:** While 20% is in US_LC_Tech (AI-heavy segment), 30% is US_LC_exTech, which doesn't fully capture CIO's expressed emphasis on AI-heavy US large caps [1]. No explicit allocation to European or Chinese large caps, which CIO added for diversification [1].\n*   **Fixed Income:**\n    *   **Alignment:** No direct fixed income comparison possible for duration or specific US IG exposures (MBS/TIPS) without more granular data.\n    *   **Deviation:** 20% in Munis; CIO is less keen on High Yield and EM Debt, but Munis aren't explicitly addressed in CIO preferences, although CIO did emphasize Investment Grade US bonds.\n*   **Cash:**\n    *   **Alignment:** 0% Cash aligns with CIO's underweight cash theme [2, 3, 4, 8, 10].\n*   **Diversification & Alternatives:**\n    *   **Deviation:** 10% Gold significantly overweights CIO's 2% allocation [1, 2, 4, 5, 10]. His 10% HedgeFund and 10% PrivateAsset are outside the scope of CIO's explicit guidance in provided documents.\n\n#### **2. Sarah Feng (CUST500) - As of August 6, 2025**\n*   **Overall Alignment Score (Qualitative):** Moderate alignment, but notable deviation on SMID and Gold.\n*   **Equities:**\n    *   **Deviation:** 20% US_SMID directly contradicts CIO's elimination of SMID [1, 2, 10].\n    *   **Alignment:** 40% US Large Cap aligns with CIO preference for large caps [1, 4]. 10% in US_LC_Tech provides some alignment with CIO's AI-heavy preference [1].\n    *   **Deviation:** No explicit allocation to European or Chinese large caps, which CIO added [1].\n*   **Fixed Income:**\n    *   **Alignment:** 35% InvGrade provides a significant allocation to Investment Grade fixed income, aligning broadly with CIO's previous overweight and current quality bias in fixed income [3, 4].\n    *   **Deviation:** No specific granular data (MBS/TIPS, duration) to confirm closer alignment.\n*   **Cash:**\n    *   **Deviation:** 5% Cash is higher than CIO's underweight cash theme (1.0%) [2, 3, 4, 8, 10].\n*   **Diversification & Alternatives:**\n    *   **Deviation:** 0% Gold contradicts CIO's recent addition of Gold for diversification [1, 2, 4, 5, 10]. No allocation to HedgeFund or PrivateAsset.\n\n#### **3. Emily Smith (CUST100) - As of August 6, 2025**\n*   **Overall Alignment Score (Qualitative):** Low alignment with current equity and diversification themes due to highly conservative stance.\n*   **Equities:**\n    *   **Alignment:** 0% in both US_LC and US_SMID means no deviation on SMID [1].\n    *   **Deviation:** Complete absence of equity exposure contradicts CIO's neutral equity stance and preferences for US large cap, European, and Chinese equities [1, 2, 4, 7, 10].\n*   **Fixed Income:**\n    *   **Alignment:** 70% InvGrade aligns with CIO's quality bias in fixed income and significantly overweights CIO's 1.0% underweight global fixed income stance as of June 4, 2025 (or previous 1.0% overweight in May) [3, 4, 10].\n    *   **Deviation:** No specific granular data (MBS/TIPS, duration) to confirm closer alignment beyond broad investment grade.\n*   **Cash:**\n    *   **Deviation:** 30% Cash significantly deviates from CIO's underweight cash theme (1.0%) [2, 3, 4, 8, 10].\n*   **Diversification & Alternatives:**\n    *   **Deviation:** 0% Gold contradicts CIO's recent addition of Gold for diversification [1, 2, 4, 5, 10]. No allocation to HedgeFund or PrivateAsset.\n\n#### **4. Jessica Brown (CUST400) - As of August 6, 2025**\n*   **Overall Alignment Score (Qualitative):** Low alignment, particularly on equity and cash preferences.\n*   **Equities:**\n    *   **Deviation:** 10% US_SMID directly contradicts CIO's elimination of SMID [1, 2, 10].\n    *   **Deviation:** 0% US_LC means no exposure to CIO's preferred US large cap (AI-heavy), European, or Chinese equity segments [1].\n*   **Fixed Income:**\n    *   **Alignment:** 60% InvGrade aligns with CIO's quality bias in fixed income and significantly overweights CIO's 1.0% underweight global fixed income stance as of June 4, 2025 [3, 4, 10].\n    *   **Deviation:** No specific granular data (MBS/TIPS, duration) to confirm closer alignment beyond broad investment grade.\n*   **Cash:**\n    *   **Deviation:** 30% Cash significantly deviates from CIO's underweight cash theme (1.0%) [2, 3, 4, 8, 10].\n*   **Diversification & Alternatives:**\n    *   **Deviation:** 0% Gold contradicts CIO's recent addition of Gold for diversification [1, 2, 4, 5, 10]. No allocation to HedgeFund or PrivateAsset.\n\n#### **5. Michael Johnson (CUST200) - As of January 1, 2025**\n*   **Overall Alignment Score (Qualitative):** High alignment on equities, but divergence on Gold. Note: Data is older (Jan 1, 2025).\n*   **Equities:**\n    *   **Alignment:** 0% US_SMID aligns with CIO's elimination of SMID [1, 2, 10]. 40% US Large Cap (specifically 40% US_LC_Tech) strongly aligns with CIO's preference for AI-heavy US large caps [1, 7].\n    *   **Deviation:** No explicit allocation to European or Chinese large caps, which CIO added [1].\n*   **Fixed Income:**\n    *   **Alignment:** 60% InvGrade aligns with CIO's quality bias in fixed income and significantly overweights CIO's 1.0% underweight global fixed income stance as of June 4, 2025 [3, 4, 10].\n    *   **Deviation:** No specific granular data (MBS/TIPS, duration) to confirm closer alignment beyond broad investment grade.\n*   **Cash:**\n    *   **Alignment:** 0% Cash aligns with CIO's underweight cash theme [2, 3, 4, 8, 10].\n*   **Diversification & Alternatives:**\n    *   **Deviation:** 0% Gold contradicts CIO's recent addition of Gold for diversification [1, 2, 4, 5, 10]. No allocation to HedgeFund or PrivateAsset."

Analysts have lowered their S&P 500 2025 earnings estimates from a 14.7% y/y growth pace in September 2024 to \r\n7.2%, and the S&P 500 ended the month trading at 22.0 times next 12-month earnings (FIGURES 8- 9). On an \r\nequal-weighted basis, the forward price earnings ratio is 16.8. Bloomberg consensus bottom-up S&P 500 \r\nestimates have been lowered to 13.5% y/y growth in 2026. \r\n3. The 2Q25 earnings season kicks off in earnest on July 15 when the big banks start to report. Tech essentially begins \r\na week later. When the largest oil companies release their results in early August, the overall earnings season \r\nshould take form. Five themes emerged from the 1Q25 reporting season. Tariffs were a focus, especially around \r\nautos, consumer electronics and materials. Artificial Intelligence (AI) remained in view with several large tech \r\ncompanies providing encouraging remarks. Tech was resilient and is the one sector expected to grow its earnings \r\nfaster than the S&P 500 in 2005, 2026 and 2027. Consumers have become more discerning with strong demand \r\nin some luxury areas offset by a willingness to trade down in other categories. Finally, supply chain dynamics were \r\nmentioned frequently, especially by firms that routinely provide color on their inventory levels. \r\n190\r\n200\r\n210\r\n220\r\n230\r\n240\r\n250\r\n260\r\n0\r\n10\r\n20\r\n30\r\n40\r\n50\r\n60\r\n70\r\n80\r\n90\r\n100\r\n110\r\n22 23 24 25\r\nInitial Claims (seasonally adjusted, \r\nthousands)\r\nChallenger Announced Job Cuts, \r\nThousands 13-week lead)\r\nChallenger Announced Job Cuts ex-Gov't\r\nUnemployment Insurance: Initial Claims, 4-\r\nweek average (13-week lead)\r\n7.3 7.2\r\n7.9\r\n6.4\r\n7.2\r\n6.5 6.7\r\n5.7\r\n10.0 10.2\r\n11.3\r\n9.2\r\n10.0 9.6 9.6\r\n8.0\r\n0\r\n2\r\n4\r\n6\r\n8\r\n10\r\n12\r\nIL NJ NYC CT CA NY MA FL\r\nTaxable-Equivalent Yield (%)\r\n10y in-state yield 30y in-state bondsCiti Wealth | North America Investment Strategy | Market Recap | 5 \r\n4.

On an \r\nequal-weighted basis, the forward price earnings ratio is 16.8. Bloomberg consensus bottom-up S&P 500 \r\nestimates have been lowered to 13.5% y/y growth in 2026. \r\n3. The 2Q25 earnings season kicks off in earnest on July 15 when the big banks start to report. Tech essentially begins \r\na week later. When the largest oil companies release their results in early August, the overall earnings season \r\nshould take form. Five themes emerged from the 1Q25 reporting season. Tariffs were a focus, especially around \r\nautos, consumer electronics and materials. Artificial Intelligence (AI) remained in view with several large tech \r\ncompanies providing encouraging remarks. Tech was resilient and is the one sector expected to grow its earnings \r\nfaster than the S&P 500 in 2005, 2026 and 2027. Consumers have become more discerning with strong demand \r\nin some luxury areas offset by a willingness to trade down in other categories. Finally, supply chain dynamics were \r\nmentioned frequently, especially by firms that routinely provide color on their inventory levels. \r\n190\r\n200\r\n210\r\n220\r\n230\r\n240\r\n250\r\n260\r\n0\r\n10\r\n20\r\n30\r\n40\r\n50\r\n60\r\n70\r\n80\r\n90\r\n100\r\n110\r\n22 23 24 25\r\nInitial Claims (seasonally adjusted, \r\nthousands)\r\nChallenger Announced Job Cuts, \r\nThousands 13-week lead)\r\nChallenger Announced Job Cuts ex-Gov't\r\nUnemployment Insurance: Initial Claims, 4-\r\nweek average (13-week lead)\r\n7.3 7.2\r\n7.9\r\n6.4\r\n7.2\r\n6.5 6.7\r\n5.7\r\n10.0 10.2\r\n11.3\r\n9.2\r\n10.0 9.6 9.6\r\n8.0\r\n0\r\n2\r\n4\r\n6\r\n8\r\n10\r\n12\r\nIL NJ NYC CT CA NY MA FL\r\nTaxable-Equivalent Yield (%)\r\n10y in-state yield 30y in-state bondsCiti Wealth | North America Investment Strategy | Market Recap | 5 \r\n4.

While \r\nthe number of jobs added and the unemployment rate were largely unchanged in May, 200k \r\nindividuals have left the workforce since January. After heavy discussion earlier in the year \r\naround federal government job cuts, economists have shifted focus to a growing number of \r\nprivate sector layoff announcements, including those from major employers like UPS, \r\nMicrosoft, Walmart, Starbucks, and Chevron. So far, these anecdotes have yet to show up\r\nin hard data. We view the near-term benign labor market and temporarily stable inflation \r\nas favorable for an on-hold Federal Reserve, keeping policy rates elevated and supportive \r\nof our short-duration tilt in fixed income.\r\n• As we discussed in last week’s CIO Bulletin, the current US tax bill now under Senate review\r\nwill likely have implications for the persistence of the US fiscal deficit, and in turn may\r\ncontribute to higher US Treasury yields. Recently, the market has newly focused on an \r\nobscure set of potential new rules in the House version of the bill called “Section 899.” This \r\nsection concerns potential taxation of foreign-owned investments in the US. While it is \r\nlikely the Senate will revise these provisions in the face of heavy lobbying, we view the \r\npotential inclusion of this language as disruptive to global asset allocators’ optimal \r\nexposures to US assets and would contribute to further USD weakness. We recently added\r\nto gold along with European and Chinese equities to diversify portfolios against a \r\npotential reduction in appetite for US assets over time.\r\n• With the S&P 500 index up over 20% from its April low and less than 3% from its all-time \r\nhigh, the market has largely priced out the potential future negative impact of recent tariff \r\nannouncements. The recent US international trade court ruling against the use of IEEPA for \r\ntariffs encourages both market participants and trading partners to view end-state tariffs\r\nas far less severe in scope and scale than the market feared on April 2nd, even as reciprocal\r\nand sectoral tariffs may take many months to finalize. We believe corporate management \r\nteams will delay large capex (ex-AI) and hiring plans until further clarity on trade rules, \r\nleading to slower economic growth and shallower EPS gains in 2H25.

While \r\nthe number of jobs added and the unemployment rate were largely unchanged in May, 200k \r\nindividuals have left the workforce since January. After heavy discussion earlier in the year \r\naround federal government job cuts, economists have shifted focus to a growing number of \r\nprivate sector layoff announcements, including those from major employers like UPS, \r\nMicrosoft, Walmart, Starbucks, and Chevron. So far, these anecdotes have yet to show up\r\nin hard data. We view the near-term benign labor market and temporarily stable inflation \r\nas favorable for an on-hold Federal Reserve, keeping policy rates elevated and supportive \r\nof our short-duration tilt in fixed income.\r\n• As we discussed in last week’s CIO Bulletin, the current US tax bill now under Senate review\r\nwill likely have implications for the persistence of the US fiscal deficit, and in turn may\r\ncontribute to higher US Treasury yields. Recently, the market has newly focused on an \r\nobscure set of potential new rules in the House version of the bill called “Section 899.” This \r\nsection concerns potential taxation of foreign-owned investments in the US. While it is \r\nlikely the Senate will revise these provisions in the face of heavy lobbying, we view the \r\npotential inclusion of this language as disruptive to global asset allocators’ optimal \r\nexposures to US assets and would contribute to further USD weakness. We recently added\r\nto gold along with European and Chinese equities to diversify portfolios against a \r\npotential reduction in appetite for US assets over time.\r\n• With the S&P 500 index up over 20% from its April low and less than 3% from its all-time \r\nhigh, the market has largely priced out the potential future negative impact of recent tariff \r\nannouncements. The recent US international trade court ruling against the use of IEEPA for \r\ntariffs encourages both market participants and trading partners to view end-state tariffs\r\nas far less severe in scope and scale than the market feared on April 2nd, even as reciprocal\r\nand sectoral tariffs may take many months to finalize. We believe corporate management \r\nteams will delay large capex (ex-AI) and hiring plans until further clarity on trade rules, \r\nleading to slower economic growth and shallower EPS gains in 2H25. As such, we remain \r\nneutral on aggregate equity exposure and are holding off on adding to risk in the near�term. Our exposures remain biased towards high quality, secular growth (like AI) which we \r\nexpect will outperform trade-sensitive cyclicals. \r\n• Portfolio considerations: The Citi Wealth Global Investment Committee met this week and\r\nmade several adjustments to improve portfolio quality and diversification (please see our \r\nJune Asset Allocation).\r\nINVESTMENT PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED · NOT CDIC INSURED · \r\nNOT GOVERNMENT INSURED · NO BANK GUARANTEE · MAY LOSE VALUE \r\nIf you need add ition al support with the acc essib ility of this material, pleas e cont act your Citi t eam or em ail us at ac cess ib ility .support@ cit i.com for as sist anc e.

We eliminated our 5.8% position in Global \r\nSMID (small- and mid-cap) equities, \r\nreallocating 4% into US large cap equities, 1% \r\ninto European equities, and 0.8% Chinese \r\nlarge caps.\r\n2. We exited our 2% thematic position in \r\nPreferreds.\r\n3. We added a 2% position in gold.\r\nFollowing a furious rebound in risk assets from the \r\npost-tariff announcement lows, we have re￾examined the risk/ reward of our current portfolio \r\nstrategy. Although we view headwinds to growth and \r\nearnings as considerable in 2H25, our assessment is \r\nthat current positioning and pricing does not reflect \r\nthese risks. We prefer to maintain an up-in-quality \r\nbias to the portfolio while adding some \r\ndiversification within equities and initiating a new \r\nposition in gold.\r\nEquities: we cut our 5.8% allocation to global SMID, a \r\nsegment which in our view is poorly positioned \r\nrelative to the macro outlook. A volatile and highly \r\nuncertain trade environment favors firms with scale \r\nand flexibility to manage rising expenses, uneven \r\ndemand, and shifting supply chains. Higher-for￾longer short-term rates will impact small firm margins \r\nmore acutely as they tend to operate with a greater \r\nshare of floating rate debt than large caps. We shift most of our SMID exposure into AI-heavy US large caps (+4%), which we \r\nbelieve will have more sustainable earnings in an uncertain macro regime. We also added diversification to the portfolio by \r\nadding 1% to Europe and 0.8% to China, two regions where the scope for flows and policy support remain high. This trade \r\nmaintains our neutral equity position, while shifting our allocation to higher quality exposures.\r\nRisk diversification: Increasingly frequent bouts of positive stock-bond correlation have led us to consider a wider range of\r\nportfolio diversification tools. We added a 2% allocation to gold, which in our view may act to provide positive returns if either \r\nthe economic data deteriorates further and/or geopolitical risks rise from here. We fund this move by eliminating our thematic \r\nexposure to US Preferreds. Preferred equity returns have proved resilient so far this year, but these securities have historically \r\noffered less diversification to equity risk when the economy slows. Preferred equity valuations are now very rich relative to\r\ncomparable sectors like investment grade credit, providing us a good opportunity to exit."
